# PalindromeNumber
Finding palindrome number or word.
This C program finds whether an entered number or word is palindrome or not. 
It also finds the palindrome numbers between a given range.

No matter either the letters in the word are in uppercase of in lower case.

Header files used:
  stdlib.h, stdio.h, string.h
Built in functions used: 
  strlen(), malloc(), strcpy(), strrev(), strcmpi(), printf(), scanf()
strlen(): To find the length of the input string.

malloc(): To allocate memory dynamically.

strcpy(): To copy one string into another.

strrev(): To reverse the string.

strcmpi(): To compare two strings, case insensitive (i.e. 'A' and 'a' are treated as same)

printf(): For console output.

scanf(): For user input.


.exe file is also uploaded so anyone can run the file by double clicking on the .exe file only, no need to open .c file.
